My name is Quoc S. Nguyen. I am Vietnamese. I currently live in Houston, Texas.
I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science at University of Houston-Downtown.

I love learning the web. My career goal is to become a web developer. My current
learning path is Ruby on Rails. I am also learning AngularJS while taking a
break from learning Ruby on Rails.

In my free time, I practice photography and surf the web for new technologies
and gadgets. I also love building pc gaming systems.
